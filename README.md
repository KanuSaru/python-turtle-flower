# Turtle Flower Pattern

This is a simple Python program that uses the **Turtle Graphics** library to draw colorful flower-like patterns. Each pattern is generated using random colors and different angles, creating unique designs every time you run the code.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `turtle` (included with Python)
* `time` (included with Python)
* `random` (included with Python)

---

## How It Works

1. The program sets up the Turtle environment with:

   * A black background
   * A random color for each run
   * A drawing speed of zero (maximum speed)

2. It defines:

   * `zero_out_turtle()`: Resets the turtle to the center and facing forward.
   * `flower(repetitions, angle)`: Draws a petal-like pattern using the given number of repetitions and rotation angle.

3. The main loop:

   * Iterates through increasing angles (from 3 to 19)
   * Draws a new flower each time
   * Waits for one second before resetting the turtle position

---

## Running the Program

Run the script in a Python environment that supports Turtle graphics (for example, the standard Python IDLE):

```bash
python main.py
```

Each iteration will display a new flower pattern for one second before the next one appears.

## Customization

* **Change the angle multiplier** in the loop to create different shapes:

  ```python
  flower(300, i * 2)
  ```
* **Modify the background color**:

  ```python
  turtle.bgcolor("blue")
  ```
* **Adjust repetitions** to make the pattern denser or sparser.

## Example Outputs
